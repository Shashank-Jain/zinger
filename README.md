A vocabulary builder, which will help us to learn new words with minimum efforts. It will be a browser extension using which we can find the meaning of a new word on a website, without navigating away from the page. These words will be displayed randomly along with the meaning and the context in which we saw them, in the form of popups from time to time while we are surfing the web.

    - [ ] Add option of not saving a word (when showing meaning)
    - [ ] Change dictionary API
    - [ ] Improve UI of meaning box (when user double clicks on a word)
    - [ ] Improve flashcard's UI
